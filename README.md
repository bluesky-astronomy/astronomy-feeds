# Astronomy feeds on Bluesky

Repo containing the firehose component that runs the [Astrosky](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:jcoy7v3a2t4rcfdh6i4kza25/feed/astro-all) and [Astronomy](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:jcoy7v3a2t4rcfdh6i4kza25/feed/astro) feeds on Bluesky, in addition to a legacy account management service and legacy feed management related things (that I should really remove...)
